## Reflection
- I've always wanted to create some form of dashboard as analytics and process management is interesting to me, so I stumbled upon an open source project management tool called Plane.so which seemed like the perfect project to clone. I could mentally map out how I would design the system from a glance and so I copied the design but tried to code it from scratch using all the skills I have gained so far.
- I haven't used Redux Tool Kit, or Material UI extensively before and so this was a good challenge to wrestle with the APIs of these technologies.
- Some of the bigger challenges was dealing with synchrony issues when dealing with consecutive RTKQueries where one query was dependant on the result of the previous query.
- It was a great experience to get used to the flow of creating APIs, testing in postman, then integrating them into the frontend and manipulating the MUI styles in the compoonents.
